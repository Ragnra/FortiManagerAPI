#FortiManager API
##Overview
prog.py - example of using the API\
./variables/ - where to store variables (and creds in my dodgy case)\
./fmg_modules/ - where the fmg_api file is (i might break this up eventually)
##Example
You can run it through importing the module via the python cli or via the prog.py file example
##Summary
I'll be adding to this as a bit of a side project\
